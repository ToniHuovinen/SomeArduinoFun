Random experiments with Arduino Uno

ReadTemp miniproject. I started to experiment with the Pyfirmata and Arduino. I created a simple circuit for measuring temperature, and then measuring that in Python. I used Spyder as IDE, Python 3.5 and newest version of Pyfirmata. Before you run this script, you need to make sure you have sent the StandardFirmata program into your Arduino through Arduino IDE.

With this project I wanted to see how easy it is to read data from Arduino using Python. I will use this project as a basis for a bigger project involving several sensors if possible and machine learning.
